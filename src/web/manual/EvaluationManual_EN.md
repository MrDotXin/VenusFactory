# VenusFactory Evaluation Module User Guide

## 1. Introduction

The VenusFactory evaluation module is a powerful tool that allows you to comprehensively assess the performance of trained protein analysis models. Through this module, you can test a model's predictive capabilities on various datasets, obtain detailed evaluation metrics, and analyze the model's strengths and weaknesses. Evaluation results can help you compare the performance of different models, select the most suitable model for specific tasks, and guide further model improvements.

The evaluation module supports the assessment of various model fine-tuning approaches. You can use predefined datasets or custom datasets for evaluation and select multiple evaluation metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of model performance.

## 2. Supported Evaluation Metrics

VenusFactory provides multiple evaluation metrics to assess model performance. Different metrics are applicable depending on the problem type.

|---------|------|------------|------|---------|
| **Accuracy** | Accuracy | Single-label/Multi-label classification | Proportion of correctly predicted samples, suitable for balanced datasets | Higher is better |
| **Recall** | Recall | Single-label/Multi-label classification | Proportion of correctly identified positive classes, focuses on reducing false negatives | Higher is better |
| **Precision** | Precision | Single-label/Multi-label classification | Proportion of correctly predicted positive classes, focuses on reducing false positives | Higher is better |
| **F1** | F1 Score | Single-label/Multi-label classification | Harmonic mean of precision and recall, suitable for imbalanced datasets | Higher is better |
| **MCC** | Matthews Correlation Coefficient | Single-label/Multi-label classification | Metric that considers all confusion matrix elements, fairer for imbalanced datasets | Higher is better |
| **AUROC** | Area Under ROC Curve | Single-label/Multi-label classification | Evaluates classification performance at different thresholds | Higher is better |
| **F1_max** | Maximum F1 Score | Multi-label classification | Maximum F1 value at different thresholds, suitable for multi-label classification | Higher is better |
| **Spearman_corr** | Spearman Correlation Coefficient | Regression | Evaluates the monotonic relationship between predicted and true values, range [-1,1] | Higher is better |
| **MSE** | Mean Squared Error | Regression | Evaluates prediction error of regression models | Lower is better |

## 3. Evaluation Interface Details
